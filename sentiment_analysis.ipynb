       " 'titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the illfated voyage on the unsinkable ship writerdirector james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april 15 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet they make for a good onscreen couple dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane kathy bates frances fisher jonathan hyde and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film the love story the action suspense and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for its few flaws titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the illfated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch',\n",

       " 'another aussie masterpiece this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural and it does very well it doesnt resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks it focuses more on emotional impact a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney  co bring to life it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago strange things begin to happen in the house and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared who was actually a mass murderer highly recommended 810',\n",
       " 'for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time no exceptions james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller through films such as aliens the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and sciencefiction goes he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful interesting and entertaining film about it the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters arent given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is roses and jacks story alone no one else emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home the music has become iconic and legendary it is composer james horners finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is only one problem the usual james cameron problem is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime my heart wont go on from this one',\n",

the big year in the release of titanic one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster i dont think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans 85 of them being teenage girls i was 12 years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong of course i grew up and didnt watch the film since i was 14 a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for 599 and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now was it worth the hype was it really the best movie of all time was that leonardos real nose ok i know thats silly to say but i did rewatch the film being completely honest here titanic is a great movie best movie of all time no just depends on your idea of a good movie but titanic delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyagebr br the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean unsuccessful they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude wearing the heart of the ocean dated the day the titanic sank 101yearold rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing she and her granddaughter elizabeth lizzy calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater in 1912 the upperclass 17yearold rose boards the ship with her fiancé cal hockley and her mother ruth dewitt bukater both of whom stress the importance of roses engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewittbukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upperclass rose and her mother are financially broke distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern before she leaps a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy firstclass formal dinner of the rapportbuilding wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance music and beer in thirdclass but after cals servant informs him of roses whereabouts rose is forbidden from seeing jack again however after witnessing a woman encouraging her sevenyearold daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea rose defies him and her mother asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean an engagement present from cal after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time they go to the deck of the shipbr br they then witness the ships fatal collision with an iceberg after overhearing the ships lookouts discussing how serious the collision is rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal meanwhile cal discovers roses nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jacks pocket upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him jack and rose return to the top deck cal and jack though enemies both want rose safe so they persuade her to board a lifeboat but after realizing that she cannot leave jack rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ships first class staircase jack and rose return to the top deck the lifeboats have gone and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose downbr br so does titanic live up to its hype i still say that this is a great movie to watch i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie but it has great acting amazing effects a wellwritten story and still looks flawless love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didnt get a lot of hype just because of leos baby face or kates amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special it will always hold a special

       " 'titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic the plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however kate winslett is wonderful as rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal billy zane early on the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game if he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyesbr br the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the titanic which has recently occurred one of the survivors of the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic with this the scene shifts to southhampton ireland where the titanic set sail from on april 10 1912 as all the passengers are boarding after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the titanics legs out to full speed the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie on april 15 1912 at 1139 an iceberg was sighted they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanics many pleas for help the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking also the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanicbr br many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship the core group of rose jack cal and roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay and all of the titanics officers were real the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards he had been a part of the white star line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaires captain when the titanic sunk the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonenglish speaking nations in addition officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss not wanting to leave her husbands side mrs strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic furthermore mr goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best the richest man on the ship john jacob astor who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat in addition molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water her ticket on the titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware the gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the postvictorian era of 1912 the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do the rich did not take well to new money such as molly brown as depicted everything of the time was very formal women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtakingbr br a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise the director james cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night in addition this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed however the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matterbr br technically the film is very well done to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie in addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the filmbr br titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic like most history novels we know the ending but it doesnt take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for youbr br ',\n",

and james spader the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film for ten seasons it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as sg1 originally the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack oneill two ls michael shanks as dr daniel jackson amanda tapping as captain samantha carter christopher judge as tealc and don s davis as major general george s hammond for ten long years we watched the team battle against the goauld the replicators the ori and many other aggressors at the same time they forged alliances with the asgard the tokra the rebel jaffa the nox and the tollan they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up not until death claimed them and sometimes not even thenbr br as with all longrunning series they were numerous cast changes michael shanks left the series in january 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor daniel jacksons successor as the teams resident archaeologistgeek was jonas quinn an alien from a country called kelowna on the planet langara played by corin nemec however shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june 2003 and nemec left at the same time unfortunately he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards don s davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go the shows original star and arguably its most popular actor richard dean anderson starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons he finally left sg1 in march 2005 in order to spend more time with his then sixyearold daughter jack oneill was by far my favourite character in the series and truth be told i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reasonbr br the ninth season represented a new era for the programme with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the goauld and the replicators in season eight many fans felt the series should go out on a high regardless the series carried on for a further two years with the ori replacing the goauld as the series main adversaries three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this reinvention ben browder came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt colonel cameron mitchell the new leader of sg1 his farscape costar the lovely claudia black began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious sexy hilarious and certainly extroverted vala mal doran a former goauld host and con artist from another planet a recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season rounding off the cast was the legendary beau bridges as major general hank landry the new commander of the sgc and an old friend of jack oneill and general hammond for the last two years they starred alongside the sg1 faithful michael shanks amanda tapping and christopher judge and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the stargate franchisebr br alas all good things must come to an end during the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of season ten ratings dropped considerably resulting in cancellation in its august 2006 after ten seasons and 214 episodes the dream was finally over on march 13 2007 what began with children of the gods ended with unending the series finale made its world premiere on sky one in britain and ireland before being shown on the scifi channel in the united states on june 22 2007br br in the ten years that the series was on the air it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series star trek in terms of popularity in certain countries it became the secondlongest running scifi series in the world second only to doctor who 19631989 and the longestrunning american produced scifi series having surpassed the xfiles only a few months before it endedbr br stargate sg1 represents the cornerstone of the stargate franchise in 2004 its success and popularity led to the production of a spinoff series entitled stargate atlantis which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in august 2008 although plans for another feature film fell through two directtodvd films stargate the ark of truth and stargate continuum were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future a third liveaction series stargate universe is also due to premiere at some point next year there was unfortunately an animated series stargate infinity which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better despite the end of sg1 and atlantis as continuing series the future of stargate looks very bright indeedbr br in conclusion while stargate has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major scifi television franchises such as star trek and doctor who its still relatively new compared to those two scifi giants

before his first live report needless to say he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire filmbr br morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freemans massive talent as an actor he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day there are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in america who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humansbr br one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewers religion i for example tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live but despite the fact that i dont believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this moviebr br jim carreys movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far hes come if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura both of which i loved by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film its amazing how far hes come he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show man on the moon and the majestic easily one of his greatest films ever jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working todaybr br jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the sidesplitting office space as bruces girlfriend who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruces growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him there is definitely some lowbrow comedy in the film that doesnt really fit with the importance of the films meaning or the quality of the delivery such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace venturas friend spike make a cameo appearance as stephen king very well knows its always nice to see familiar characters its almost like seeing family againbr br bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him the thing i love about this is that like i said before religion is absent from my life but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way which empowers the message even morebr br the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position the jimmy hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records the scene where bruces rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera and my favorites the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakerys cooking the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes such as when he says to god who reveals that hes the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his christmas parties must be real bashes and to be careful about drinking because on of him might need a ride home i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes a little too true and as gallagher would add behind every great man is also an amazed motherinlawbr br bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection it is a comedy written and performed in good taste but with enough relatively lowbrow humor to keep the kids entertained this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family which is becoming rarer and rarer these days in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy its nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching dont miss this one',\n",

auditoriums of the cinema the presence of a radio in just about everyones house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to worlds events and provided many a drama and especially comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh realitybr br the literature of the time also flourished at all levels the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures but the comic book just did not magically appear all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages all by itself there were mediums that were ancestral to them obviouslythe newspaper comic strip was one parent providing the visualnarrative method of story tellingbr br the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine the inexpensive prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going though not necessarily serialized tales the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borroughs tarzan and johnston mcculleys zorro the 1930s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow the avenger g8s battle aces and the spidermaster

doc savage stories were very popular in the 1930s and 40s and were published into the middle 50s then they went into a hiatus for a good 1215 years then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new container the paperback book a fresh look to the cover art was introduced featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc with a perpetually ripped shirtbr br the reintroduction proved to be highly successful with the publication of a title a month and for a while more soon there was a rumor of a doc savage movie but when by what producer well the venerable man of bronze was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together it was veteran stopaction animator and producer of top special effects films geoprge pal who did the film along with warner brothersbr br when doc savage man of bronze arrived in the movie houses it boasted of a well casted team of actors albeit a largely no name as far familiarity with the viewers with former tarzan of tvron elys nearly perfect casting in the lead up and coming beauty of a starlette pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler as the villainous captain seas no other name would have been recognized and just maybe that was a plus in this casebr br the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going use of narration by paul frees and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the storybr br from the very start there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured camp humor as the batman tv series some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected unlikely outcomes for example an experiment of docs with a miniature rocketmissile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish a small one at that the whole story unfolds like that hitting the viewer with a little camp every so often as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously we are also puzzled about mr george pals being the producerhis last he who had been so well known for special effects surely a factor that could be put to good use in a scifi action setting of the pulp characters worldbr

middle of a freeway system andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society that alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed just untilbr br straight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them both of them get involved with crime andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesnt dare going out of the house dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues dont treat him very well and with the respect he deserves the amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it this is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away and of course that is exactly what happensbr br the rest of the story places dave and andrew in this world of nothingness at first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still leftbr br nothing features an incredibly small cast  in fact besides the first couple of shots from the film we only see dave david hewlett and andrew andrew miller in the entire film it is clear that in order to pull this off the cast has to be more than up for the task because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of closeup head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well director of photography derek rogers also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it but we dont see it right awaybr br obviously this cant be an event driven film and its not much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void and thats where some of the most hilarious scenes take place especially in the case of when andrew discovers a candy barbr br now one could be thinking how does nothing look like well it looks like nothing indeed the entire world of nothing is white white no matter in what direction you look this is the weakness of this film after an hour or less its getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure its more interesting to look at thank god there are some for example at times when the two lads due to the properties of nothing are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of tofu as andrew claims its fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little societybr br one of the best parts of the film is the set production designer jasna stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this all in all the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watchingbr br however the very best part of the film is the acting both david hewlett and andrew miller really look like the professional actors they both are the camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said there are just about no props in the film they are really on a bare stage with plenty of character development and some decent oneliners clever dialogue at times hilariously stupid it all works to that end  and this really moves the movie away from the lowbudget area to wellcrafted handworkbr br lets talk a little about the visual effects because they are definitely worth mentioning nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film theres a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film and although the drews have milked that scene completely its still fun to watch one of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where andrew and dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment  they have the abilities to wish everything away so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appearbr br nothing is a bright and welllit movie it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead this is in fact one of their theories but nothing is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory we dont know where they are or what has happened to them we dont know if they will ever get out because the movie ends before we see anything like that the ending by the way is not as good as it couldve been its rather easy to predict what is going to happen still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end its a reasonably satisfactory onebr br take hollow man kill bill cube epoch and lots of other films and you have nothing it really is an amalgam of different styles still there is no other film at least that i know of nothing is really like for the people remembering the original cube production commentary on its dvd may remember that vincenzo natali talked about how he came up with the story of cube he talks about him and andré bijelic having been roommates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out nothing could very well be the screened version of the origin of the cube story and to that end its almost like one of the cube prequelsbr br what can i say i enjoyed nothing it is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely wellmade with tons of intelligent ideas still i feel the movie is missing something and i have problems finding out precisely what it is maybe if we have a nothing 2 i can answer that question nothing is a great film but not as good as i expected it to bebr br final rating 75  10',\n",

       " 'my former cambridge contemporary simon heffer today a writer and journalist has put forward the theory that just as british filmmakers in the eighties were often critical of what they called thatchers britain the ealing comedies were intended as satires on attlees britain the britain which had come into being after the labour victory in the 1945 general election this theory was presumably not intended to apply to say kind hearts and coronets which is if anything a satire on the edwardian upper classes or to the ladykillers or the lavender hill mob both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature it can however be applied to most of the other films in the series especially passport to pimlicobr br pimlico is or at least was in the forties a predominantly workingclass district of london set on the north bank of the thames about a mile from victoria station it is not quite correct to say as has often been said that the film is about pimlico declaring itself independent of britain what happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by king edward iv to the duchy of burgundy this means that technically pimlico is an independent state and has been for nearly five hundred years irrespective of the wishes of its inhabitants the government promise to pass a special act of parliament to rectify the anomaly but until the act receives the royal assent the area remains outside the united kingdom and british laws do not applybr br because pimlico is not subject to british law the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local shopkeepers can sell whatever they please to whomever they please unhindered by the rationing laws when other traders start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets the british authorities are horrified by what they regard as legalised blackmarketeering and seal off the area to try and force the burgundians as the people of pimlico have renamed themselves to surrenderbr br many of the ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system either as an individual as happens in the man in the white suit or the lavender hill mob or as part of a larger community as happens in whisky galore or the titfield thunderbolt the central theme of passport is that of ordinary men and women taking on bureaucracy and governmentimposed regulations which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the britain of the forties the films particular target is the rationing system during the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against nazism but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime it was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in 1945 and organisations such as the british housewives league were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing i cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the films satire were the spivs black marketeers who play a relatively minor part in the action or the housewives league who do not appear at all the satire is very much targeted at the bureaucrats who are portrayed either as having a rules for rules sake mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at allbr br i suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with pimlico remaining independent as a british version of monaco or san marino indeed i suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a tv sitcom rather than a film in 1949 however four years after the end of the war the filmmakers were keen stress patriotism and british identity so the film ends with pimlico being reabsorbed into britain one of the bestknown lines from the film is we always were english and we always will be english and its just because we are english that were sticking up for our right to be burgundians there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense tolerance and good humour of the cockneys of pimlico all of which are presented as being quintessentially british characteristicsbr br most of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave but in the last scene after pimlico has rejoined the uk the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain global warming may have altered things slightly but for many years part of being british was the ability to hold the belief whatever statistics might say to the contrary that britain had an abnormally wet climate the ability to make jokes about that climate was equally importantbr br there is a good performance from stanley holloway as arthur pemberton the grocer and smalltime local politician who becomes the prime minister of free pimlico and an amusing cameo from margaret rutherford as a batty history professor in the main however this is appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film it lacks the illwill and rancour of many more recent satirical films but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that it remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and with the possible exception of kind hearts and coronets is my personal favourite

past the scene and as jules pans upwards we see the first strike of the day american airlines flight 11 smashes into the face of the north tower of 1 world trade pfeiffer orders his men into the fire

impact of the second plane united airlines flight 175 with 2 world trade he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers watching and capturing the crowds reaction to the unimaginable gideon

boyfriends friends as one by one each firefighter carrying 60 lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother kevin as he leaves to do his selfless duty also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke but jules is respectful never once does he capture a sensationalistic momentthe money shot his work is professional through his baptism of fire he also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken father michael judd the chaplain for the fire department then as jules and chief pfeiffer

he takes the audience through the events of september 11 robert de niro hosts the program in a sombre restrained way he never seeks the camera for his own glory rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see i also commend cbs for their bravery at airing this special chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who
